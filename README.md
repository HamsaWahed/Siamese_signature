# Handwritten Signature Detection and Verification
Authentication is an important factor to manage security. Signatures are 
widely used for personal identification and verification. Many documents 
like legal transaction and bank cheque requires signature verification. 
Signature-based verification of a multiple number of documents is a time- 
consuming and difficult task. Consequently, an explosive growth has been 
seen in biometric personal verification and authentication systems  as 
traditional identity verification methods such as passwords, tokens, pins 
suffer  from  some  fatal  flaws  and  are  incapable  to  satisfy  security 
necessities. In this assignment you will be tasked with identifying whether 
a handwritten signature is real or forged and detecting the signature in a 
document.
